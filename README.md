countdown.py is currently the only working code. It is the core functionality of the timer that is stable and works well

qavcountdown.py is a version I'm trying to implement the ability to upload branding into. I want users to be able to 
upload branding of their choice to be displayed on the timer screen. They should be able to adjust/resize/reposition 
the branding as needed.

You can probably ignore any other files in there, the folder's just a bit messy.

The idea behind this all is to use this timer as a replacement to paid timer apps for use in show.

Most of this code was written with the help of GPT-4o.
